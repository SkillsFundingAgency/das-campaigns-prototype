               Apprenticeship standards are designed by groups of employers known as ‘trailblazers’. These employers work together to
               make sure each new standard meets their own skill needs, those of their sector and those of the economy. If you think
               there’s a need for this apprenticeship, why not form a <strong>trailblazer</strong> group to design it?
