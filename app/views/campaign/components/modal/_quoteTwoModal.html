                         <p>
                              At Hays Travel, apprenticeships have supported our continued expansion and success.
                              Apprentices have taken the lead in our social media marketing and E Learning platform,
                              sharing their digital knowledge with colleagues. They bring a wealth of energy,
                              diversity and talent, which enables us to be innovative and proactive.

                         <p>
                              We deliver most of our apprenticeship training in-house â€“ but for our specialised
                              apprenticeships, we collaborate with training providers, scheduling regular meetings
                              to review the development of our apprentices. Our programmes are designed to equip
                              apprentices with everything they need for a successful career.

                              Our internal training, human resources and recruitment teams work closely together to
                              enhance the recruitment process. They analyse feedback from managers and apprentices,
