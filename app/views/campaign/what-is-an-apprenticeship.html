                    <p>An apprenticeship gives you hands-on experience, a salary and the opportunity to train while you work.   You get a same as other employees: a contract of employment, holiday leave and sick pay.   Anyone from the age of 16 can become an apprentice as long as they're living in England and not in full-time education.</p>
                    <p>An apprenticeship is a real job. It's a way to:</p>

                        <li>gain official certification of your skills, equivalent to a qualification ranging from level 2 (GCSE equivalent) up to degree level</li>
                        <li>start a long-term career path with the possibility of higher earnings</li>

                    <p>An apprenticeship can take 2 to 4 years to complete depending on which level you do.   </p>

                    <p>By successfully completing your apprenticeship, you'll have gained the confidence and skills needed to progress in your chosen career. </p>

                    <p>Apprenticeships are available across a wide range of industries and organisations, from local businesses to large national brands.</p>

                    <p>Apprenticeships have been through a massive change in the last few years.  They're not the 'easy option' and studying whilst you're working takes hard work!  Degree apprenticeship are now recognised as credible alternatives to full-time university courses. </p>

                <p>There are hundreds of different apprenticeships you can do - from different industries and levels; which cater for you depending on whether you’re at the start of your career, wanting to change career direction or returning to work after a break. </p>

                <p>Here’s a brief explanation of the different levels - which are numbered from
                2 - 7.  </p>

                <p>Degree apprenticeships offer the benefits of higher education with none of the cost.  Your tuition fees are paid for by the government and your employer, so you will graduate debt-free.  Apprentices earn a salary right from the start of their employment and training. </p>
