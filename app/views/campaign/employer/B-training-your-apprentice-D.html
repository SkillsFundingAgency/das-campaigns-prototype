                          <p>
                               Apprentices must spend at least 20% of their time completing off-the-job training, so you’ll
                               need to <a href="/campaign/FAT/1-FAT-search">find an apprenticeship training provider</a> to help deliver this.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              Whether it’s a practical exercise or a written assignment, apprenticeship off-the-job training is
                              hugely valuable for both you and your apprentice. Investing in their development can ensure they
                              feel valued, while enhancing their productivity – and, as a result, the impact they make within
                              your organisation.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              They’ll be taught new knowledge and skills to achieve occupational competence. The apprentice should
                              already have the required level of English and maths, so this kind of training won’t count towards
                              the 20% off-the-job training requirement.
                          </p>

                          <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading2">Training your apprentice on the job</h2>

                          <p>
                               Throughout the apprenticeship, you’ll supervise your apprentice and provide them with on-the-job
                               training. This is training your apprentice needs to perform the work for which they’ve been
                               employed. It’s not linked to the knowledge, skills and behaviours set out in the apprenticeship
                               standard, which is why it does not count towards their off-the-job training requirement.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              For example, an apprentice baker might need to understand the equipment, machinery and process
                              limitations within their organisation. This knowledge is not listed in the advanced baker
                              standard, so the apprentice’s employer will need to help them develop it.
                         </p>

                          <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading3">Training can be delivered flexibly to suit you</h2>

                          <p>
                               An apprenticeship is a work-based programme, so all off-the-job training must take place within the
                               apprentice’s normal working hours (excluding overtime). You can work with your training provider to
                               decide when, where and how it’s delivered – for example:
                          </p>

                          <ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
                              <li>at the apprentice’s usual place of work, or at an external location</li>
                              <li>as part of each day, a day a week, one week out of five or as block release</li>
                              <li>using any existing training programmes or materials you have</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>
                               The training must be delivered away from the apprentice’s working duties, teaching them new knowledge,
                               skills and behaviours that are required for their apprenticeship.
                         </p>

                          <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading4">There’s a straight-forward commitment statement – not hours of paperwork</h2>

                          <p>
                               A commitment statement must be in place from the beginning of the apprenticeship. This sets out the
                               training an apprentice will receive and which elements count towards off-the-job training.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              The apprentice’s evidence pack needs to demonstrate what training has been delivered against the commitment statement.
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading5">Which activities count as off-the-job training?</h2>

                         <p>
                              As a rule of thumb, an activity should count towards apprenticeship off-the-job training if you
                              can answer <strong>‘yes’</strong> to all these questions:
                         </p>

                         <ol class="list list--number list--number-employer">
                             <li>Is the person signed up to the apprenticeship programme?</li>
                             <li>Is the activity directly relevant to the apprenticeship?</li>
                             <li>Is the activity teaching new knowledge, skills and behaviours?</li>
                             <li>Is the learning taking place in the apprentice’s paid working hours?</li>
                        </ol>
