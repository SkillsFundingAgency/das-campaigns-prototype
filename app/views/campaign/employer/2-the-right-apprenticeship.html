                               When you're looking for an apprenticeship, make sure you:

                          <p>
                              Apprenticeships are being developed all the time, so keep a lookout for new apprenticeships that have been added.
                          </p>

                          <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading2">Types of apprenticeship</h2>

                          <p>
                               Apprentices must work towards an approved apprenticeship standard or framework. Their training must last at least 1 year.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                               An apprenticeship standard contains a list of the skills, knowledge and behaviours an apprentice will need to
                               have learned by the end of their apprenticeship. Standards are developed by employers and industry experts to
                               be occupation focused, which means the learning happens throughout the apprenticeship. There’s an assessment at
                               the end to prove the apprentice can carry out all aspects of the job, so they’ll be ready to make valuable
                               contributions.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                               There’s a huge variety of apprenticeship standards to choose from - and if there’s a specific standard you’re
                               looking for that isn’t currently available, you can

                          <p>
                               Apprenticeship frameworks are a series of work-related qualifications. There is no end-point assessment for this type of
                               apprenticeship.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                               All apprenticeship frameworks will be withdrawn by 2020. This will be a phased approach as employers take on
                               more apprentices using the new apprenticeship standards.

                              Apprenticeship standards describe the knowledge, skills and behaviours that bring full competence in a particular
                              occupation.  They describe how an apprentice can demonstrate mastery of this occupation by the end of the

                          <p>
                              You should agree with the end-point assessment organisation the cost of the end-point assessment.
                              Your training provider will contract with your chosen end-point assessment organisation
                              and pay them on your behalf.
