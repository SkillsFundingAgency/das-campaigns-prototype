                              <p>
                                   Apprenticeship standards are developed by groups of employers, known as ‘trailblazers’, to make
                                   sure they’re occupation-focused. Each standard sets out key knowledge, skills and behaviours
                                   (KSBs) that employers have identified they need.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                   Your apprentice will be assessed to demonstrate what they’ve learnt, and that they can perform all
                                   aspects of the occupation. This ‘end-point assessment’ is conducted by an organisation that is
                                   independent from the training provider. They’ll make sure all apprentices following the same
                                   standard are assessed consistently.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                   Each standard includes an end-point assessment plan, which describes how the apprentice should be
                                   tested against appropriate criteria, using suitable methods. For example, your apprentice may
                                   need to complete:
                              </p>

                              <ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
                                   <li>a practical assessment</li>
                                   <li>an interview</li>
                                   <li>a project</li>
                                   <li>written and/or multiple-choice tests</li>
                                   <li>a presentation</li>
                              </ul>

                              <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading2">Finding an end-point assessment organisation</h2>

                              <p>
                                   Only organisations on the
                                   <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations" class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">register of end-point assessment organisations</a>
                                   are eligible to conduct the assessment. You must select an organisation from the register
                                   and agree a price for them to carry it out.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                   Although the training provider will be involved in arranging the end-point assessment, the
                                   assessment itself must be independent. The training provider must work with the end-point
                                   assessment organisation on your behalf and have a written agreement in place to pay them for
                                   conducting the assessment.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                   It’s worth getting in touch with the end-point assessment organisation early on in the
                                   apprenticeship to check what the assessment involves. This will give your apprentice plenty
                                   of time to prepare - for example, they may need to gather evidence to show how they’ve
                                   been working towards the core knowledge, skills and behaviours.
                              </p>

                              <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading3">The cost of an end-point assessment</h2>

                              <p>
                                   The cost of the end-point assessment is included in the overall price agreed with the training provider for the
                                   apprenticeship. This cost will not usually exceed 20% of the funding band maximum. Check our
                                   <a href="/campaign/employer/B-how-much-is-it-going-to-cost-C">funding guidance</a>
                                   to learn about apprenticeship costs and government funding.

                              <p>
                                   When your apprentice successfully completes their apprenticeship, they’ll be awarded a certificate. The end-point
                                   assessment organisation will request this certificate on your behalf.
                              </p>
