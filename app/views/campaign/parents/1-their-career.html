                                   Setting off on a career path can be overwhelming for young people. As their parent, guardian or
                                   carer, you’ll play a key role in guiding them as they take their next step. Whether they get top
                                   grades or don’t thrive in academic environments, apprenticeships shouldn’t be overlooked. With
                                   new higher and degree apprenticeships popping up each year, they could get the best of both
                                   worlds – learning and earning at the same time.

                              <p>
                                   Perceptions of apprenticeships as entry-level, trade-based, low-quality courses persist – yet
                                   this couldn’t be further from today’s reality. Changes to funding, minimum requirements and the
                                   development of occupation-focused standards have driven up the quality of apprenticeships, and
                                   employers are taking notice. While earning a wage, apprentices gain highly transferable skills
                                   and qualifications (which could include a degree) to set them up for a wide range of career paths.
                                   Alongside this, they’ll gain hands-on experience in a real-world setting – an invaluable asset when
                                   it comes to future employment.
                              </p>

                              <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading2">They’ll earn a salary – and their training will be paid for</h2>

                              <p>
                                   An apprenticeship can boost a young person’s career, while offering great financial benefits.
                                   They’ll be paid (at least the national minimum wage, but often a more competitive salary), and
                                   they’ll spend at least 20% of their time completing off-the-job training – at no cost to them.
                                   This could include working towards a degree or other qualifications. At the same time, they’ll
                                   gain experience in a real workplace, and develop important soft skills as they transition into
                                   the world of work.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                   From digital marketing and teaching to dental healthcare and textile manufacturing, there’s a standard
                                   for everyone – and the number available is constantly on the rise. You can use the <a href="/campaign/apprentice/2-find-an-apprenticeship">Find an apprenticeship</a>
                                   tool to see what’s on offer. During the apprenticeship, your child will gain important insight into their
                                   chosen industry – and if they decide the occupation isn’t for them, they’ll be equipped with skills and
                                   qualifications to make them extremely employable, no matter what step they take next. In fact, 88% of
                                   apprentices remain in employment after completing their apprenticeship.

                                   If your child isn’t sure which route to take, it’s worth remembering that they can keep
                                   their options open. They could apply for both university degrees and apprenticeships,
                                   for example, and make their final decision when they’ve had more time to research and reflect.

                         Not only has Katie worked towards a degree while getting paid, but she’s also been given so much
                         responsibility managing projects at an early stage in her career. She had been accepted to study
                         primary education at university, but decided that pathway wasn’t for her and applied for an apprenticeship
                         instead. We feel proud that Katie had the spirit not to follow the expected route, and could see the
                         benefits of a vocational learning pathway. We would strongly encourage parents to discuss an
                         apprenticeship with their child. It allows a person to learn and develop in the real world.
