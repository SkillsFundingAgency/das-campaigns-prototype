                                   Setting off on a career path can be overwhelming for young people. As a parent, you’ll play a
                                   key role in guiding and supporting them as they take their next step. Whether they don’t thrive
                                   in an academic environment or they get top grades, apprenticeships shouldn’t
                                   be overlooked. In fact, with new higher and degree apprenticeships popping up each year, they
                                   could get the best of both worlds – learning while earning at the same time.

                              <h2 class="heading-l" id="heading1">Apprenticeships in a nutshell</h2>

                              <p>
                                   Apprenticeships have evolved significantly in recent years. They offer the chance to earn a wage,
                                   while learning important skills and gaining qualifications. An apprentice spends at least 20% of
                                   their working hours completing off-the-job training, developing transferable skills for a wide
                                   range of career paths. They could even get a degree as part of the apprenticeship. Alongside
                                   their training, they gain hands-on experience in a real-world setting – an invaluable asset when
                                   it comes to future employment.
                              </p>

                              <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading2">They’ll earn a salary – and their training will be paid for too</h2>

                              <p>
                                   An apprenticeship can boost a young person’s career, while offering great financial benefits.
                                   They’ll be paid (at least the national minimum wage, but often a more competitive salary), and they’ll
                                   spend at least 20% of their time completing training – at no cost to them. This could include working
                                   towards a degree or other qualifications. At the same time, they’ll gain experience in a real workplace,
                                   and develop important soft skills as they transition into the world of work.
                              </p>

                                   From digital marketing and teaching to dental healthcare and textile manufacturing, there’s a standard to suit everyone –
                                   and the number of apprenticeships available is constantly on the rise. You can use the
                                   <a href="/campaign/apprentice/2-find-an-apprenticeship">Find an apprenticeship</a>
                                   tool to see what’s on offer. Once they’ve started their apprenticeship, they’ll gain important insight into
                                   their chosen industry, while learning about a host of roles within the organisation. If they decide the
                                   occupation they’ve chosen isn’t for them, they’ll be equipped with skills and qualifications to make them
                                   extremely employable, no matter what step they take next.
                                   <strong>In fact, 88% of apprentices remain in employment after completing their apprenticeship.</strong>
