                <p>There are hundreds of different apprenticeships you can do - from different industries and levels; which cater for you depending on whether you’re at the start of your career, wanting to change career direction or returning to work after a break. </p>

                <p>Here’s a brief explanation of the different levels - which are numbered from
                2 - 7.  </p>

                <p>Degree apprenticeships offer the benefits of higher education with none of the cost.  Your tuition fees are paid for by the government and your employer, so you will graduate debt-free.  Apprentices earn a salary right from the start of their employment and training. </p>
